# Ultimate Decider

A Vue application for two people which allows them to play simple randomised games to a best of 5. Currently only features Memory Match and Rock, Paper, Scissors as available games, however new games can easily be added.

This was a group project, worked on with David Strain and Rebekah Salem-Dalgety.
